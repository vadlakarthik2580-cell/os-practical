/*
 *
 * Investigates the relationship between hardware resources and OS services
 * by using fork() + execvp() + wait() to run: uname, lscpu, lsblk, free, ps, top
 *
 * For each command, the program (parent) forks a child, the child execs the
 * real Linux utility, and the parent waits for it — then prints a short
 * explanation of what that command reveals about OS abstraction.
